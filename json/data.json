    "question": "This project was created for Sports innovation campus in Bruges. They asked us to create a digital application to encourage the youth to exercise more.  We were given trampolines by the client. ",
    "solution": "In our solution we created an endless runner game that can be controlled by jumping on the trampoline. The game was created in Unity. The design was made in Figma. The backend existed of an Xbox Kinect where the jumps were detected and registrated with node.Js. The backend data was sent to the frontend through a websocket.",
    "role": "I worked on this project with three other classmates. My role in this project was Ux/Ui Research, Design and  the frontend development of the game (in association with a frontend partner). The others worked on research, Ui implementation, communication with backend and the backend itself. ",
    "gamePlay": "The game is a endless runner game where two players have to work together to steer a boat through a river full of obstacles. Every time the boat hits an obstacle it gets slowed down for a second. There is also a shark chasing them and as soon as he catches up with the boat the game ends. The goal of the game is to stay ahead of the shark for as long as possible.",
    "aftermath": "In our demo and expo, where we set up the game for the public, we noticed that the setup often was a bit difficult to understand. Especially the calibration of the Players proved a very difficult part of the game. Once the people started playing the game itself, we found that they really liked it. They often played more then once to improve their high score. Even though the game was designed for the youth we found that adults liked it a lot as-well, which was really satisfying for us to see.

    "question": "For my bachelor thesis I worked with two other classmates on a project for Smile Safari. They asked us to create an interactive digital room, where people could take lots of pictures for social media. Most important for our client was that it was interactive and resulted in great pictures.",
    "solution": "We created an emersive lightroom with ledstrips and Arduino Uno board. These ledstrips were hung on the wall to guide the visitors into the room. We also used a Led matrix in combination with an arduino board to create our big led background, which was curved to avoid sharp corners on the photo. Lastly we used a Kinect Azure with Touchdesigner software to transfer real life feed to a led matrix giving control to the visiters",
    "role": "My role in this project was as wel Research the target audience as well as the best UX for the room. Aside from my research role I was also the lead creative developer working with all the Arduino and led strips/matrix and Touchdesigner software. ",
    "gamePlay": "The room is designed to give every visitor a unique and social media worthy experience. Visitors would enter the room seeing a dark hallway. When they move the led strips they pass would flash on creating a tunnel of light that follows them. Once they reach the end of the room a Kinect will detect the visitors and register their movements. TouchDesigner will then transfer the movements to a led matrix, creating a magical interactive background. ",
    "aftermath": "For our bachelor thesis we made a prototype, maquette and 3D render of the room. The owner of Smile Safari also came to our final presentation. After the presentation Smile Safari contacted us for more information and the specific schemes of our installation. We were told they plan on building the room in one of their musea. Until this day we still excitedly await notification that our room has actually been build for real.",

And especially how you can combine these together to transform output from Tensorflow to input for Unity.  I will definitely use this in future projects. I had a blast.",

    "aftermath": "The 3D modelling is a lot of work and very time consuming, but the 3D print totally makes it worth its time. While I had a fair share of frustrations during the modelling, I enjoyed the overall process. The satisfying result of having your 3D model makes it all so much more fun. In the end my keychain was not really a keychain anymore, but that’s oke. I learned a lot, which was the goal after all.",
